Jokes Application
==================
A basic spring boot web application that generates a random Chuck Norris joke and
displays it on a web page.
This app has two branches that show how to configure a spring boot application with xml based config or a java config.

## Prerequisites

* Java 1.8 JDK or JRE installed on your machine
* the app uses port 8080 by default, so this port should be free

## Run the Jokes App
you can use the included maven wrapper scripts to run the app:
* on *NIX systems, from the projects root directory, run the following from your shell: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

* on windows systems, from the projects root directory, run the following from a command prompt: `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`

* point your web browser to: `http://localhost:8080`
* reload the page to see a random Chuck Norris Joke
